        <h2>Understanding Polygons in Computer Graphics</h2>

        <p>Polygons are fundamental geometric shapes widely used in computer graphics. They are closed figures with straight sides. Polygons play a vital role in various applications, including computer-aided design, video games, and simulations.</p>

        <h3>Properties of Polygons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Polygons are made up of line segments.</li>
            <li>Each segment intersects exactly two others, with one common endpoint.</li>
            <li>Polygon sides cannot cross each other.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Polygons:</h3>
        <p>Polygons can be classified based on the arrangement of their sides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Convex Polygons:</strong> All interior angles are less than 180 degrees.</li>
            <li><strong>Concave Polygons:</strong> At least one interior angle is greater than 180 degrees.</li>
            <li><strong>Complex Polygons:</strong> Polygons that are neither convex nor concave.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of Polygons:</h3>
        <p>Understanding polygons is crucial for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating 3D models in computer graphics software.</li>
            <li>Defining the boundaries of objects in simulations.</li>
            <li>Rendering complex shapes in video games.</li>
        </ul>
