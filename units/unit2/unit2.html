            <h3>Introduction to Polygons</h3>
            <p>Polygons are fundamental geometric shapes in mathematics and computer graphics. A polygon is a closed two-dimensional figure with straight sides. Each side intersects exactly two other sides, and the vertices (corners) of the polygon are where these sides meet. Polygons are characterized by their number of sides, which also determines their names. </p>
