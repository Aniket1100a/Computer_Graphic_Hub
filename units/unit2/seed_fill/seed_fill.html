        <h2>Introduction to Seed Fill Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Seed fill algorithms, also known as flood fill algorithms, utilize a starting point (seed) to fill connected regions with a specific color or pattern. These algorithms are fundamental in computer graphics and are widely used in various applications, including paint software, graphical editors, and game development.</p>
        <p>By understanding the efficiency and intricacies of seed fill algorithms, developers and designers can create visually appealing and vibrant graphics, making them essential tools in the world of digital art and design.</p>
        <h2>Use Cases and Applications</h2>
        <p>Seed fill algorithms find extensive use in the following graphics applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paint Software: Used to fill closed shapes and areas with colors or textures.</li>
            <li>Graphical Editors: Enables users to fill regions, creating diverse visual elements.</li>
            <li>Game Development: Utilized for level design, terrain generation, and texture filling.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Steps for Seed Fill Algorithm</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a seed point within the area to be filled.</li>
                <li>Check the neighboring pixels of the seed point.</li>
                <li>If the neighboring pixel is part of the area (has the same color or properties), fill it and add it to the list of pixels to be checked.</li>
                <li>Repeat step 3 for all neighboring pixels.</li>
                <li>Continue this process until there are no more pixels to be checked.</li>
            </ol>
