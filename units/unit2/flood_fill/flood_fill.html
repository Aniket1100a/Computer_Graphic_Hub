        <h2>Understanding Flood Fill</h2>
        <h3>Principle:</h3>
        <p>Flood Fill is an area-filling algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array. It recursively spreads color from a source point to neighboring points until a boundary is encountered. This algorithm is foundational in applications requiring efficient area coloring and boundary detection.</p>

        <h2>Flood Fill Techniques</h2>

        <div class="flood-fill-method">
            <h3>Boundary-Fill Algorithm:</h3>
            <p>We explore the Boundary-Fill variant of the Flood Fill algorithm, focusing on its ability to color areas enclosed by boundaries. Learn the intricacies of boundary detection and understand how this technique is employed in graphic design applications for precise area coloring.</p>
            <div class="flood-fill-steps">
                <p>The Boundary-Fill algorithm fills the interior of an enclosed area. It checks if the current pixel is a boundary pixel. If not, it fills the current pixel and recurs for neighboring pixels.</p>
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check if the current pixel is a boundary pixel or within the boundary.</li>
                    <li>If it is not a boundary pixel, fill the pixel with the desired color.</li>
                    <li>Recursively apply the Boundary-Fill algorithm to neighboring pixels.</li>
                    <li>Continue until all interior pixels are filled, avoiding boundary pixels.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Seed-Fill Algorithm:</h3>
            <p>Delve into the Seed-Fill variant, a versatile approach that allows users to fill areas based on seed points. Understand the role of seed points in initiating the flood fill process and explore its applications in user-driven colorization and interactive design.</p>

            <div class="flood-fill-steps">
                <p>The Seed-Fill algorithm starts from a seed point and fills the area connected to the seed. It checks if the current pixel is within the boundary. If yes, it fills the pixel and recurs for neighboring pixels.</p>
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose a seed point inside the area to be filled.</li>
                    <li>Check if the current pixel is within the boundary.</li>
                    <li>If it is inside the boundary, fill the pixel with the desired color.</li>
                    <li>Recursively apply the Seed-Fill algorithm to neighboring pixels.</li>
                    <li>Continue until all connected pixels within the boundary are filled.</li>
