        <h2>Even-Odd Method</h2>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> The Even-Odd Method, also known as the Ray Casting Algorithm, evaluates the number of intersections between a ray cast from the point and the edges of the polygon. If the number of intersections is odd, the point is inside the polygon; if it's even, the point is outside.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong> This method is widely used in graphic rendering engines for its simplicity and efficiency. It's employed in various applications, from computer-aided design to video game development, ensuring accurate rendering of complex shapes.</p>

            <h3>Steps for Even-Odd Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cast a ray from the test point in any direction.</li>
                <li>Count the number of intersections between the ray and the edges of the polygon.</li>
                <li>If the number of intersections is odd, the point is inside the polygon; if it's even, the point is outside.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Winding Number Method</h2>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> The Winding Number Method calculates the winding number of a point concerning the polygon. By analyzing the angle formed between the point and the polygon vertices, this method determines whether the point is inside or outside the polygon. A winding number of zero indicates the point is outside, while a non-zero value signifies the point is inside.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong> The Winding Number Method is particularly useful in applications requiring precise spatial analysis, such as geographical information systems and architectural design software. Its accuracy makes it a preferred choice for applications where precision is paramount.</p>
