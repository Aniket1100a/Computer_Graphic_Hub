        <h2>What is Aspect Ratio?</h2>
        <p>Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image, screen, or display. It is expressed as a ratio (e.g., 16:9), indicating how many units wide an image or screen is for every unit of height.</p>

        <img class="img_resolution" src="img\wide_aspect_ratio.png" alt="Wide Aspect Ratio Image" class="aspect-ratio-image">
        <p>A wide aspect ratio provides a cinematic feel in movies and videos.</p>

        <img class="img_resolution" src="img\square_aspect_ratio.webp" alt="Square Aspect Ratio Image" class="aspect-ratio-image">
        <p>Square aspect ratios are often used for artistic and creative purposes.</p>

        <h2>Common Aspect Ratios</h2>
        <img class="img_resolution" src="img\common_aspect_ratio.jpg" alt="common Aspect Ratio Image" class="aspect-ratio-image">
        <p>Some common aspect ratios include 4:3 (standard monitors), 16:9 (widescreen monitors and HDTVs), and 1:1 (square format). Different aspect ratios are suitable for various applications, such as movies, presentations, and social media content.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Visual Perception</h2>
        <p>Aspect ratio influences how images and videos are perceived. Wide aspect ratios provide a cinematic feel, while square formats are often used for artistic and creative purposes.</p>

        <h2>Aspect Ratio in Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>In web design, understanding aspect ratio is vital for creating responsive layouts. Maintaining the correct aspect ratio ensures that images and videos display correctly across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
