        <h2>Introduction to Display Devices</h2>
        <p>A display device, also known simply as a display, is an output device for presenting visual information or data to an audience. It can be any of several types of devices, such as a computer monitor, television, projector, or screen on a handheld device like a smartphone or tablet.</p>

        <p>Display devices are an essential component of various electronic systems, including computers, televisions, gaming consoles, and smartphones. They work by converting electrical signals into visual information that can be perceived by the human eye. Different types of display technologies exist, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays (now largely obsolete), and more recently, microLED displays.</p>
