                <h2>Primitives</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Points: Simplest primitive representing a single point in space.</li>
                    <li>Lines: Connects two points, forming a straight line segment.</li>
                    <li>Polygons: Closed shape formed by connecting multiple points with straight lines. Triangles and quadrilaterals are common polygon types.</li>
                    <li>Curves: Smooth, curved lines defined by control points. BÃ©zier curves and splines are examples of curves used in computer graphics.</li>
                    <li>3D Solids: Geometric shapes such as spheres, cubes, cylinders, and cones in 3D space.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Attributes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color: Specifies the color of the primitive. Colors can be represented using RGB values (Red, Green, Blue) or other color models.</li>
                    <li>Texture: A bitmap image applied to the surface of a primitive, adding detail and realism.</li>
                    <li>Shading: Determines how light interacts with the surface of a primitive. Common shading models include flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading.</li>
                    <li>Transparency: Specifies the opacity of the primitive, allowing objects to be partially see-through.</li>
                    <li>Reflection: Defines how much light is reflected off the surface of the primitive.</li>
                    <li>Refraction: Determines how light is bent as it passes through a transparent surface.</li>
                    <li>Specularity: Controls the intensity of specular highlights on the surface of the primitive.</li>
                    <li>Transformations: Apply transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling to position and orient primitives in 2D or 3D space.</li>
                </ul>
