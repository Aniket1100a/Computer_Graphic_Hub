        <h2>What is Resolution?</h2>
        <p>Resolution refers to the number of pixels (individual colored dots) contained on a display screen. It is commonly expressed as the width and height of the screen in pixels. For example, a screen resolution of 1920x1080 means there are 1920 pixels in width and 1080 pixels in height.</p>

        <h2>Pixel Density and Quality</h2>
        <p>Higher resolutions mean more pixels, which generally translates to a clearer and sharper image on the screen. Resolution is a crucial factor in the quality of images and videos displayed on devices like computer monitors, televisions, smartphones, and cameras. It impacts how much detail can be displayed and how sharp the images and text appear.</p>

        <h2>Screen vs. Print Resolution</h2>
        <p>Screen resolution is often measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI) and impacts the quality of on-screen content. Print resolution, on the other hand, affects the quality of printed materials.</p>

        <h2>Aspect Ratio and Resolution</h2>
        <p>The aspect ratio of an image, defined by its width-to-height ratio, is closely related to its resolution. Different resolutions and aspect ratios can impact how an image is displayed on various screens.</p>

        <h2>Choosing the Right Resolution</h2>
        <p>Selecting the appropriate resolution is crucial for creating and displaying images effectively. It depends on factors like the intended use, screen size, and printing requirements.</p>
