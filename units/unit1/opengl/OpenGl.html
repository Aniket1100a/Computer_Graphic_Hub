        <h2>Introduction to OpenGL</h2>
        <p>OpenGL, which stands for Open Graphics Library, is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Developed by the Khronos Group, OpenGL provides developers with a set of functions to create high-quality computer-generated images and interactive applications. It is widely used in the fields of computer graphics, simulation, video games, virtual reality, and scientific visualization due to its versatility and performance.</p>
        <p>Originally introduced in 1992, OpenGL has undergone several updates and enhancements, making it a robust and efficient tool for graphics programming. One of the key features of OpenGL is its ability to work across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-based systems. This cross-platform compatibility allows developers to create applications that can run seamlessly on different devices and platforms.</p>

        <p>OpenGL operates as a low-level API, providing access to the graphics hardware through a set of commands and functions. It allows developers to create complex 2D and 3D scenes, apply textures and lighting effects, and perform various transformations on graphical objects. OpenGL also supports shader programming, enabling developers to create highly customized and visually stunning graphics effects.Due to its open nature and widespread adoption, OpenGL has a large and active community of developers and resources, making it a popular choice for graphics programming tasks ranging from video game development to scientific simulations. Additionally, OpenGL has paved the way for modern graphics APIs and technologies, shaping the landscape of computer graphics and interactive applications.</p>

        <h2>Rendering Techniques</h2>
        <div class="rendering-techniques">
            <h3>Rasterization</h3>
            <p>Rasterization, also known as scanline rendering, converts 3D models into 2D images pixel by pixel. It's fast and efficient, commonly used in real-time graphics, such as video games.</p>
        
            <h3>Ray Tracing</h3>
            <p>Ray tracing simulates the behavior of light rays, tracing their paths as they interact with objects, calculating reflections, refractions, and shadows. Commonly used in movies, animations, and high-quality still images for realistic lighting effects.</p>
        
            <h3>Global Illumination</h3>
            <p>Global Illumination techniques, like Radiosity, simulate how light bounces and diffuses multiple times, creating soft, indirect lighting and color bleeding effects. Used in architectural visualization and movie production for realistic interior lighting.</p>
        
            <h3>Photon Mapping</h3>
            <p>Photon mapping tracks photons emitted from light sources, simulating their interactions with surfaces and storing this information for rendering. Commonly used in creating realistic caustics and complex light effects.</p>
        
            <h3>Shadow Mapping</h3>
            <p>Shadow mapping calculates shadows by rendering the scene from the light's perspective and storing depth information. It's then used during the final render to determine shadows. Used in real-time graphics for dynamic shadows in video games and interactive applications.</p>
        
            <h3>Screen Space Reflections (SSR)</h3>
            <p>SSR calculates reflections by analyzing the screen space, capturing reflections only where they are visible on the screen. Commonly used in real-time applications for water and reflective surfaces.</p>
        
            <h3>Depth of Field (DOF) and Motion Blur</h3>
            <p>DOF blurs objects outside a specific focal range, simulating camera focus. Motion blur adds blur to moving objects, creating a sense of motion. Used in movies, animations, and simulations to enhance realism and cinematic effects.</p>
        
            <h3>Post-Processing Effects</h3>
            <p>Various post-processing effects like bloom, ambient occlusion, and color grading are applied after the initial rendering to enhance visual quality and style. Commonly used in video games and movies to improve aesthetics and mood.</p>
