        <h3></h3>
        <div class="subpoint">
            <h3>Pixel</h3>
            <p>A pixel, short for "picture element," is the smallest unit of a digital image or display. It represents a single point in a raster graphics image and can display different colors or shades. Pixels are the building blocks of digital images and screens, and the quality of an image often depends on the number and arrangement of pixels.</p>

        <div class="subpoint">
            <h3>Resolution</h3>
            <p>Resolution refers to the number of pixels in each dimension that can be displayed on a screen. It is typically expressed as width x height (e.g., 1920x1080), indicating the number of horizontal and vertical pixels. Higher resolutions result in sharper and more detailed images.</p>

        <div class="subpoint" >
            <h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
            <p>Aspect ratio is the ratio of the width of an image or screen to its height. Common aspect ratios include 4:3 (standard), 16:9 (widescreen), and others. It determines the shape of the displayed content and affects how images and videos appear.</p>

        <div class="subpoint">
            <h3>Frame Buffer</h3>
            <p>A frame buffer is a region of memory used to store the data that represents each pixel on a display screen. It holds the color and intensity values for all the pixels in the display, allowing for real-time updates and rendering.</p>
